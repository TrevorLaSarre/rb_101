1. Casual
    - Given two integers
    - Set the value of a variable equal to the sum of those integers
    - Return that variable
  
  Formal
    START
    
    # Given two integers (int_1 and int_2)
    SET sum = int_1 + int_2
    READ sum
    
    END

2. Casual
    - Given an array of strings
    - Extract the first string from the array and assign it to a new variable
    - Iterate through the remainder of the array, concatonating each remaining string to the new variable
    - Return that variable
    
  Formal
    START
    
    # Given an array of strings
    SET iterator = 0
    SET new_string = nil
    
    IF iterator <= Length of array
      IF new_string = nil
        new_string = string at array[0]
      ELSE
        new_string += array[iterator]
    
    iterator = iterator + 1
    
    READ new_string
    
    END

3. Casual
  - Given an array of integers
  - Create a new, empty array
  - Creat a variable called "counter" and set it to 0
  - Iterate through the given array, keeping track of iterations with counter
  - If counter is an even number (including zero), move the "counter-ith" element from the given array to the new array
  - If counter is an odd number, skip over that element
  - Return the new array
  
  Formal
  
  START
  
  # Given an array of integers
  SET new_array = []
  SET counter = 0
  
  WHILE counter >= length of old_array - 1
    IF counter is even number
      add element at counter-ith position in old_array to new_array
    ELSE
      skip
  
  READ new_array
