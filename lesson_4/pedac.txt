Questions:
  - What should the method return if the input is not a string?
  - What constitutes a substring?

Input: String
Output: An array containing strings

Rules:
  Explicit:
    - The method should return all substrings of the input string that are palindromes
    - Palindromes are case sensitive (mom is a palindrome while Mom is not)
    
  Implicit:
    - The method should return an array of strings
    - The substrings do not need to be separate words -- arrangements of letters within the input string count
    - If there is no input, the method should return an empty array
    - If the input string does not contain any palindromes, the method should return and empty array
