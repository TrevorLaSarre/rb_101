numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The delete_at method takes as an argument the index of the element that you would like to delete. For instance, numbers.delete_at(1) would delete the numbers
at index [1], which in this case is the integer 2. The delete method, however, takes as an argument the actual element that you would like to delete. For 
instance, numbers.delete(1) would delete the numbers 1. Importantly, both of these methods return the element that they deleted and mutate the caller.
