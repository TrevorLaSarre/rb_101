The ! in ruby is used in a few distinct ways. When appearing before a variable, value, or equal sign, it generally means "NOT", or the opposit of that
thing. For instance != means "not equal" and !true means "not true" (i.e. false). When used in front of a value, it inverts the truthiness of that value
(i.e. !3 and !"cat" evaluate as "false" and !nil and !false evaluate as "true"). Addiitonally, methods that end with a ! typically mutate the caller.
However, this is simply convention and can not be counted on as a hard and fast rule. 

The ? in ruby also has a few distinct uses. It can be prepended on an integer to return a string version of that integer (i.e. ?3 evaluates as "3"). More
commonly, it is used on the end of a method name to indicate that that method returns true or false. Finally, it is used as a character in the ternary 
operator. 

1. != means "not equal" and is often used in conditional statements. (i.e. If number != 3...)
2. !user_name == false
3. [1, 2, 2, 2, 3].unique! == [1, 2, 3]
4. ?3 == "3"
5. 3.odd? == true
6. !!user_name == true
